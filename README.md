 **Check_In_Delivery**

 A web application to allow warehouse employees to check-in their deliveries. Employees create a delivery receipt by entering company details, item count, and a note. This app was created in response to a business problem where paper receipts were getting lost and the warehouse was being charged restocking fees and charge-backs. In building this app, I displayed proficiency in OOP paradigm, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, ActiveRecord, and HTML. 
  - Engineered an app with routing, user authentication and displays, leveraging the MVC framework to separate concerns and increase future scalability.
  - Developed the Sinatra framework to develop 18 routes accomplishing CRUD functionality for Deliveries and Users controllers.
  - Utilized Bcrypt-Ruby gem and Sessions controller to achieve secure user authentication within the app.
  - Designed 3 dynamic forms with HTML5 and embedded Ruby (ERB) to collect and persist app data.
  - Created User and Delivery models with ActiveRecord to persist data in mySQL database.
  
  **How to run application**
   - Fork and clone the repository. 
   - cd into the check_in_delivery directory. 
   - in the command line run <code>shotgun</code>.
